why WRB O

increased VBN O

the DT B-NP

Second JJ O

why WRB O

Any DT B-NP

Third NNP B-NP
, , O
the DT B-NP
theory NN I-NP
suggests VBZ O
why WRB O

who WP O
pay VBP O
too RB B-NP
much JJ I-NP

For IN O

once RB O
the DT O

have VBP O

The DT O
one CD O
exception NN B-NP
to TO O
this DT B-NP
recent JJ I-NP
trend NN I-NP
was VBD O
the DT B-NP

Fourth NNP B-NP

the DT B-NP
theory NN I-NP

the DT B-NP
extent NN I-NP
that IN O

the DT B-NP
theory NN I-NP

To TO O
the DT B-NP
extent NN I-NP
that IN O

Finally RB O

the DT B-NP

Is VBZ O

Three CD O

Second JJ O

if IN O

reasons NNS O

First RB O

its PRP$ O
position NN B-NP
in IN O
the DT B-NP
government NN I-NP
is VBZ O
anomalous JJ O

It PRP B-NP

an DT B-NP
unusual JJ I-NP
kind NN I-NP
of IN O
independence NN B-NP

Thus RB O
we PRP B-NP
have VBP O
a DT B-NP
condition NN I-NP
that WDT O
is VBZ O
easily RB O
described VBN O
as IN O
undemocratic JJ O

Second JJ O
, , O
the DT O
responsibilities NNS O
of IN O
the DT B-NP
Federal NNP I-NP

as IN O
guardian NN B-NP
of IN O
the DT B-NP

the DT B-NP

they PRP B-NP

just RB O

the DT B-NP

The DT B-NP

like IN O
high JJ B-NP

slow JJ B-NP

while IN O
the DT O
